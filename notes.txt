music input data:
    - Metadata
        - BPM
        - notes per beat
        - macro speed?
    - Instruments
        - volume macros
        - note macros
    - Channels
        - Segments
            - Notes

SFX input data:
    - metadata
        - track
        - instrument
        - speed
        - length
    - notes

Things the engine needs to be able to do:
    - load song w/o playing it (prep the song)
    - start, pause, and restart song on command.
    - Play SFX over song w/o pausing song
    - play multiple SFX with priorities?

Sequence data
    - notes and commands
    - commands are $80 & CMD
    - note values are indexes into note table
        - total of 96 notes available

TODOs:
    - cmdFnInstrument
        only volume macro is loaded into pointer table

    - cmdFnHalt
        currently just BRK's. should stop all sound on given channel (across all channels?)

    - WriteBuffers
        use update flags to determine what buffers to write

    - SoundProcess
        - frame/order progression
        - process instrument on frame
        - all of sfx stuff (a bunch is currently commented out)

    - PAL/NTSC detection (low priority)

TODO on stream:
    - load song on button press (keep load and play separate?)
    - stop playback on button press (clear all buffers and write them)
    - get sounds playing, ignoring instruments (ie, solid tones)
        - are buffers updated? are they written?
    - frame/order progression
